<p>I like to discuss political issues as I like show my opinions to the people I trust. I tend to be more liberal as I don't like catching up authorities' orders and I'll never find the right way to suck them up.</P>
</br>
<p>Of course the lives of myself and the people I care about are the first priority.I am faithful to the nation while I look down upon the famous poeple who trying to sell their busty but useless mind,while I become a fascist when seeing pinkles sucking their authorities up and showing no mercy to the people in "opposite"</p>
</br>
<p>I wanna be mad? No. I wanna stay on my mind track.</p>
