 ##  Speech by Charlie Chaplin from The Great Dictator movie.<br>


I'm sorry but I don't want to be an Emperor - that's not my business. <br>
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. <br>
I should like to help everyone if possible, Jew, gentile, black man, white. <br>
We all want to help one another, human beings are likethat. <br>

We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. <br>
We don't want to hate and despise one another. <br>
In this world there is room for everyone and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. <br>
The way of life can be free and beautiful. <br>
But we have lost the way. <br>

Greed has poisoned men's souls - has barricaded the world with hate; <br>
has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. <br>
We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in: <br>
machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. <br>
Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind. <br>
We think too much and feel too little: More than machinery we need humanity; <br>
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. <br>
Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. <br>

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. <br>
The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodnessin men, <br>
cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all. <br>
Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world,<br>
millions of despairing men, women and little children,<br>
victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.<br>
To those who can hear me I say Do not despair.<br>

The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed,<br>
the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress:<br>
the hate of men will pass and dictators die, and the power they took from the people,<br>
will return to the people and so long as men die, liberty will never perish...<br>

Soldiers - don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you,<br>
enslave you - who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel,<br>
who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder!<br>
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts!<br>
You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men!<br>
You have the love of humanity in your hearts.<br>
You don't hate - only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural.<br>
Soldiers - don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty!<br>

In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written the kingdom of God is within man -<br>
not one man,<br>
nor a group of men - but in all men - in you!<br>
You the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness!<br>
You the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful,<br>
to make this life a wonderful adventure!<br>
Then in the name of democracy let us use that power - let us all unite!!!<br>

Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work,<br>
that will give you the future and old age and security.<br>
By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power,<br>
but they lie!<br>
They do not fulfil their promise, they never will!<br>
Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people!<br>
Now let us fight to fulfil that promise!<br>
Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed,<br>
with hate and intolerance!<br>
Let us fight for a world of reason,<br>
a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.<br>

Soldiers - in the name of democracy, let us all unite!!!<br>
