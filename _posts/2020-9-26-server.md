># Server set up
> In order to make my progress to set up servers more convenient, I placed some pratical **script** on Log-in, SSR, V2ray, BBR and etc.

>**SSR**       wget -N --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToyoDAdoubi/doubi/master/ssr.sh && chmod +x ssr.sh && bash ssr.sh

>**V2ray**     bash <(curl -s -L https://git.io/v2ray.sh) 
>
>**L2TP**      wget https://git.io/vpnsetup -O vpnsetup.sh
>
>**BBR**       wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/teddysun/across/raw/master/bbr.sh
>
>          chmod +x bbr.sh
>
>          ./bbr.sh

>          uname -r

>          sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control

>*Recommend V2ray for swifter and more security connecting experience  
>*You might wonder why **L2TP** is an option though it's old-fashioned. However to some **ios** users in China mainland don't have the access to download other VPNs.
# As a noob  
To me, Git hub is a hole new world for my interest and further career building. Indeed,study is more important to a student though the world without GFW is beautiful. That is also why I use Github to extend my insights. VPN is the main character.
